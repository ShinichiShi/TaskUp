# TaskUp

TaskUp is a simple Task Management application built using Next.js and MongoDB. It uses a **Kanban** approach for managing tasks, allowing users to organize tasks into different columns based on their status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed). Users can create, view, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete or incomplete. The application supports basic task details like title, description, and due date. All data is persistently stored using MongoDB and the app is hosted on Vercel for easy deployment.
